        <h1 class="recipe-title">Tortas Ahogadas</h1>
        <p> “Tortas Ahogadas” (salsa-drowned sandwiches) are typical of 
            Guadalajara city in the State of Jalisco. They are made with 
            a roll called "salted Birote", which is different from the traditional 
            Mexican bread  “bolillo”. Birote has a sour taste and a very hard crust 
            slightly similar to a crusty baguette or a mild sourdough.

                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook the tomatoes in a pot with water, drain and blend in blender with garlic, vinegar, oregano and salt.</li>
                        <li>In a large pot put the sauce to a boil 1 / 2 hour, adding water, depending on how liquid you would like it 
                            (in many places it is thick in others don’t, depending on your taste) taste the salt, if you feel that it 
                            needs more oregano, add more, or a little more vinegar, it should be a little acid, but rich … I know that 
                            this recipe is quite a personal taste, sorry, but it will depend a lot on your taste for spices and vinegar, 
                            this is the basis, ok?</li>
                        <li>For the Hot sauce, cook the 15 Arbol Chiles in water for about 15 minutes or until tender, place them in a 
                            blender or food processor with a little of the cooking water, ½ clove of garlic, salt and puree until smooth. 
                            Strain and it is ready …be careful with this sauce is very spicy!</li>
                        <li>Now to assembly the sandwich, spread some refried beans on each side of the rolls, top bottom half with a portion 
                            of the Pork Carnitas, served on a plate and top with the tomato salsa, serve with marinated onions alongside, 
                            a wedge of lemon and … dig in! If you like to spice your sandwich add the árbol sauce.</li>
                    
                    </ol>
